# HR Analytics

### Project overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the company's employees performance. By analyzing various aspects of the employee data, we seek to identify trends to help improve employee performance and reduce retention rate by making data-driven recommendations.

### Data Sources

The dataset used for this analysis is the "HR_Analytics.csv" file, containing detailed information about all the employees of the company.

# Tools

﻿﻿PowerBI - Data Cleaning, Data Analysis and Report creation
  
### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

1. ﻿﻿﻿Data loading and inspection.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the employees data to answer key questions, such as:

- Is there an apparent pattern for attrition ?
- What are the major factors for attrition ?
  
### Data Analysis

Analysed data by the means of various Visualizations like Column Chart, Donut Chart, Area Chart, etc. to map out a detail version of employees' attrition pattern in various aspects.

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

1. There are several patterns which are very clear through the visualizations :
   - Employees tend to leave when one year is completed at the company.
   - Most of the people leave during the ages of 26 - 35.
   - Small Salary bracket also leads people to leave along with less salary hike.
     
2.  The major factors are Time and Money and employees in Sales department which amounts to almost 40 % to the total retention rate.
   
### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions :
- Have an interactive seminar before one year ends to understand the needs of the employees better and vice versa.
- Invest in a benefits program so that if not by salary, people stay for the work culture.
- Start a perfomance based hike to help retain Sales staff which is the department with the highest attrition rate.

### Limitation
The employee dataset lacks an attribute 'Reason for leaving' which could have helped to dig deeper into any other potential factors which is present other than numbers.
